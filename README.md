# Learning Python

This is just a repo to keep track of the Python lessons and exercises I've been working on:

+ exercises from PracticePython.org
+ private mentoring with Ray Phan
+ the beginning of a banking app to get started with OOP (mentoring with Jessamyn Smith)
+ daily(-ish) practice through PyBites. Even though PyBites lets users code puzzles directly on the platform, I'd like to keep track of my progress and _review solutions_ in Jupyter notebooks.

## More about this process

I've been blogging about my experience of learning Python. [See the posts >](https://www.thomasdeneuville.com/category/python/)
